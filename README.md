# Enigma
C++ Implementation of Enigma

Enigma 1 with static reflector A initialized.
It takes 3 rotors in any order with a static reflector.
The code is not full abstract, so it requires a small change to accept more rotors and a dynamic reflector.

Currently the Plugboard is not implemented and the Enigma has a bug!
